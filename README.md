# About

This repository contains code samples from my talk [Parsing, Compiling, and
Static Metaprogramming][talk] at JSConfEU 2013. You can find [slides for the
talk on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/pdubroy/parsing-compiling-and-static-metaprogramming).

[talk]: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/patrick-dubroy-parsing-compiling-and-static-metaprogramming.html

## Esprima Examples

`checkstyle.coffee` and `logging.coffee` contain the original source code for
the style checker and logging examples presented in the talk. `checkstyle.js`
and `logging.js` are the slightly simplified JS versions the were shown in
the talk.

## PEG.js Example

`altjs.coffee` is the code for the "AltJS language in 5 minutes" presented
in the second half of the talk.

## Extra Special Bonus!

`idgrep.coffee` (and `idgrep.js`) is another example of using Esprima
to do static analysis on JavaScript code.
